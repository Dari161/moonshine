GitHub Pages does not allow direct server configuration since it's a managed hosting service provided by GitHub for hosting static websites directly from a GitHub repository.

However, GitHub Pages automatically compresses assets, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, before serving them to visitors. This compression helps reduce the size of files transferred over the network, improving website loading times.

Therefore, if you're hosting your website on GitHub Pages, you don't need to manually enable GZIP compression for HTML files. GitHub Pages takes care of compression for you.

Keep in mind that if you're using Jekyll, a static site generator supported by GitHub Pages, you can also configure additional optimizations in your _config.yml file, such as minification of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, to further improve website performance.
